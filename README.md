_*I submerge the boards on a painters solvent bath to clean the flux residue which I haven't any problem until the DC jack came, as you see, didn't took the solvent bath kindly :P_


**Back**

_*The footprint for the second crystal (Y2) was wrong on this board but it's already corrected on the KiCAD files._
